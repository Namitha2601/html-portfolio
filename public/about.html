<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Namitha and this is my portfolio site. I’m a Junior Product and Graphic designer living in Chennai, Tamilnadu. 
   I'm a hard working individual with a great attention to detail and love making clean, appealing and elegant design.</p>

<p>I enjoy new and challenging projects that push me to learn more in the field of UI UX and Graphic design. 
   Throughout college, I have gained great time management skills that allow me to work on multiple projects at once. 
   I am also a keyboardist and a self-taught skilled mandala artist. I also make and sell Mandala art during my free time beyond UI UX and Graphic design.</p>

<p>As a passionate and motivated person, I’m constantly striving to improve my techniques, expand my skillset and find new opportunities to grow. 
  Please enjoy my portfolio, and feel free to get in touch with any questions.</p>
